# Codeheirs subspace club

A randomly generated world which displays all codeheir's subs in the amazing subspace club

## TODO:
1. Make it use the twitch api which retrieves all subs
2. Have it poll the api to update current subs
4. Sort out this issue with potential security vulnerability
5. Do a little bit of refactoring, especially splitting up the twitch commands
6. Create guide for README.md on how to set up the database
7. Do a recording of the screen and post a gif in here too
8. Output the amount of experience required to get to the next level - Started, maybe error around here
9. Display the xp multiplier on the screen
10. Have flames persist
11. Add !comeonscreen for OrangeGames369
12. Add AI to farm points

## Create a tmi.js api-options
In order to run locally you'll need to set up tmijs configurations in order to connect to twitch.
