# Codeheirs subspace club

A randomly generated world which displays all codeheir's subs in the amazing subspace club

## TODO:
* Make it use the twitch api which retrieves all subs
* Have it poll the api to update current subs
* Sort out this issue with potential security vulnerability
* Do a little bit of refactoring, especially splitting up the twitch commands
* Create guide for README.md on how to set up the database
* Do a recording of the screen and post a gif in here too
* Output the amount of experience required to get to the next level - Started, maybe error around here
* Add !comeonscreen for OrangeGames369
* Add AI to farm points
* Figure out how to retrieve



## Create a tmi.js api-options
In order to run locally you'll need to set up tmijs configurations in order to connect to twitch.
