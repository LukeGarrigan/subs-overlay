# Codeheirs subspace club

A randomly generated world which displays all codeheir's subs in the amazing subspace club

###TODO:
1. Make it use the twitch api which retrieves all subs
2. Add all the different types of subs spaceships
3. Potentially add some stars
4. Have it poll the api to update current subs
5. It would be cool if subs could !flame (blue/green/red) to customise their rocket
6. Subs who are currently watching will have the active flag, which means they can pick up food, which means they level up! 
    
    6.1. Could add a !boost to increase their chance of hitting food
    
    6.2. Could add a multiplier for xp depending on number of viewers
