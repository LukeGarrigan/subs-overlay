# Codeheirs subspace club

A randomly generated world which displays all codeheir's subs in the amazing subspace club

##TODO:
1. Make it use the twitch api which retrieves all subs
2. Have it poll the api to update current subs
3. It would be cool if subs could !flame (blue/green/red) to customise their rocket
4. Could add a multiplier for xp depending on number of viewers


## Create a tmi.js api-options
